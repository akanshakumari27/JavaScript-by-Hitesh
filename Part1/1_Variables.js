// JavaScript is 'Dynamically typed language'
// example: when initalizing any variable, we don't need to declare it's variable type, like it's int, bool etc

// A language is called Dynamically typed if the ‘type’ of a variable is checked only during the 'runtime' unlike at 'compile time' in a statically typed language. 
// With this support, the developers need not specify the data type of any variable while writing the code.

// It also supports changing the datatype of variables at runtime as well.

// During compile time in js it automatically identified variable's datatype
